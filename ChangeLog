	* z-model: Looking at the brightness of the same neuron across
	levels, the optimal lambda_z~3500.  Given that lambda_x = 2000,
	this corresponds to equivalent dz=0.756dx.  i.e. roughly the same
	decrease is observed when we are 4 pixels away in x direction or 3
	pixels (levels) in the z direction.  I tried it again with raw
	pixel values instead of fitted activations and got 5700.  Better
	make this a parameter.  Fit a whole 20 image block [18:37] to
	optimize the parameters?  Or just write the sequential stuff.  But
	how can we initialize z values?

	* view: When the image on the canvas changes, the pixel values of
	the original image are still reported.  Debug
	display.jl:updatexylabel.

	Can use the transpose option for canvas.

	* jumps: The scenes jump at 18,38,58 etc, which is inconsistent
	with the z-levels from askin.
