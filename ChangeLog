	* shift: Vahdet says there is a slight xy shift every z-level,
	which causes the 17-18 jump.  How much is the shift?
	julia> ztrack(img32,18,57)
	(37,[316,235,16,31,237,340,15,29,320,286,20,37])
	(38,[269,215,17,37,221,338,20,28,287,275,15,29])
	diff:  47  20  -1  -6  16  2  -5  1  33  11  5  8

	Looking at different transitions, I can't get anything consistent.
	With visual inspection I got dx=2.5, dy=1.0 pixels per frame drift.

	* gauss.jl: Tried exponential and power law, compared to gaussian.
	Exponential is worse, power law is better.  The z/x ratio is
	consistently around 1.57, i.e. one z level is equivalent to 1.57 x
	pixels.  For Gaussian, one stdev on xy plane is 11.3 pixels, in z
	direction 7.3 levels.  For zmodel, this corresponds to a Lambda of
	2053 and ZX=1.5.  For 1/(1+(L/2)r^2) power-law model, L is 8160.
	Or if we use 1/(1+(r/R)^2), then R is 8 pixels.  Compare with
	sigma=11.3 pixels with the Gaussian.  Square law drops to half the
	peak value in 8 pixels, Gaussian in 13.4 pixels.

	* zmodel.jl: fixed drawing.  still suspect hyperparameters.  need
	to fit gaussian in 3D to see the exact centers and the z/x
	relation.

	* zmodel.jl: first successful tracking.  need to play with
	hyperparameters to optimize.  loses centers between blocks of 20.
	need to draw circles instead of adding two images to see what is
	going on.  need to make use of relative location info, currently
	each neuron is allowed to move independently in the model.

	* z-model: Looking at the brightness of the same neuron across
	levels, the optimal lambda_z~3500.  Given that lambda_x = 2000,
	this corresponds to equivalent dz=0.756dx.  i.e. roughly the same
	decrease is observed when we are 4 pixels away in x direction or 3
	pixels (levels) in the z direction.  I tried it again with raw
	pixel values instead of fitted activations and got 5700.  Better
	make this a parameter.  Fit a whole 20 image block [18:37] to
	optimize the parameters?  Or just write the sequential stuff.  But
	how can we initialize z values?

	* view: When the image on the canvas changes, the pixel values of
	the original image are still reported.  Debug
	display.jl:updatexylabel.

	Can use the transpose option for canvas.

	* jumps: The scenes jump at 18,38,58 etc, which is inconsistent
	with the z-levels from askin.
